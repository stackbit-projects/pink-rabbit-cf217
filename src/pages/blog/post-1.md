The Washington Street Advocacy Group has released a statement after the Landmarks Preservation Commission's decision to take "no action" on Howard Hughes's proposal for 250 Water Street on January 12, 2021:

“The Washington Street Advocacy Group joins preservation organizations across New York City in commending the Landmarks Preservation Cpmmission for declining to approve the illegal and out-of-scale design of 250 Wafer Street by the Howard Hughes Corporation.

Disregarding decades-long precedent, Howard Hughes had asked the Commission to consider an extralegal and unenforceable promise that they would offer a $50-million gift to the South Street Seaport Museum.

Advocates had been demoralized last week after an epic blitz of controlled testimony organized by lobbyists.

The Landmarks Preservation Commission’s courageous action affirms the continued independence and thoughtful judgement of the city’s outside commissions and good government bodies.

This defeat is a defeat for the de Blasio administration as much as for Howard Hughes Co. and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. As with other failed administration schemes like the effort to move Charging Bull, the de Blasio administration failed to consider the independence of the city’s volunteer commissions and community boards.”

**Todd Fine, President, Washington Street Advocacy Group**
